# react-oppgave-2 (repository)

This repository contains a small Next.js project used for React exercises.

The actual Next.js app lives in the `react-oppgave-2/react-oppgave-2` folder (it was created with the Next.js starter).

## Quick start (from repository root)

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```powershell
cd react-oppgave-2\react-oppgave-2
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app.

## More

The project folder contains a fuller `README.md` with additional Next.js notes. See `react-oppgave-2/react-oppgave-2/README.md` for details.

If you want me to move the project root (so the package.json sits at the repository root) or to add CI/deploy instructions, I can do that next.
